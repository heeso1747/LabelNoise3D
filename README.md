## ðŸ“š Background
- **Challenge:** Training deep learning models for 3D object detection requires extensive annotated 3D data (e.g., bounding boxes), which is costly and slow to create manually.
- **Common Approach:** Pre-training models on pseudo-labels generated by high-performing models, followed by fine-tuning on a smaller set of human-annotated ground truth data.
- **Problem:** Pseudo-labels are not perfect and introduce "label noise" into the training process.
- **Research Goal:** To systematically analyze the impact of this label noise during the pre-training phase.
- **Key Question:** What is the maximum acceptable level of noise in pseudo-labels before the advantages of pre-training are lost or performance degrades?
- **Objective:** To establish best practices for training 3D object detection networks with noisy labels, especially for applications in autonomous driving and robotics. I 


## ðŸ“Œ Tasks and Execution:
 **1. Literature Review** \
Survey relevant work on pseudo-labeling, label noise in deep learning, and 3D object detection training pipelines (e.g., PointPillars, PV-RCNN, BEVFusion)

 **2. Experimental Setup** \
Set up a dataset with human-annotated 3D labels and generate variants with controlled levels of synthetic label noise (e.g., added jitter, missing labels, false positives)

 **3. Noise Impact Analysis** 
- Conduct systematic experiments across multiple noise levels and models
- Evaluate performance on standard benchmarks (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes) using relevant metrics (e.g., mAP, IoU)

 **4. Compilation** \
Compile the work and results in a comprehensive thesis


## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure and Folder Properties
TBD

## ðŸš€ Using Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/
``` 

### 2. Install `uv` for dependencies
- `uv` is a package manager that simplifies the installation and synchronization of dependencies.
- **Requirement**: Python 3.10 or higher

```bash
# (Recommended) standalone
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv lock    # run once on first use
uv sync    # synchronize dependencies

# (Inside .venv) pip install
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install uv
uv sync
```
